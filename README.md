# # Voronoi Algorithm

This code makes point that nearest from the reference point and express RGB colors.

It uses Python image, random and math library.
X-axis mean imgx, it has 200 pixel. Y-axis mean imgy, it has 100 pixel. 
By using a list, i can define a values about nx, ny, nr, ng,nb.
And then it measures the distance to determine the shortest distance. 
(x,y) pixel that the shortest distance point has the color of nr[j], ng[j], nb[j].
